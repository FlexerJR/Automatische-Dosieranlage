!!!Preface and Safety Notices!!!
This dosing system is a DIY project that I designed for my pool. It is intended for a Bestway Steel Pro Max 427x122 with a volume of 15 cubic meters. The entire project is subject to changes or updates to bring it up to the latest standard.
The system construction takes about 48 hours, depending on craftsmanship skills.
 
A long-term test is done!
 
I appreciate your likes, boosts, and feedback.
Since I use a solar system for this pool, I installed a D50 PVC fixed piping system. It's important to know this as the dosing system works best with it.
 
Please note: You always act at your own risk. Minor electrical work is required, and safe handling of chemicals is essential for safe operation. Please do not put yourself in danger, and consult a professional if unsure. You act at your own risk. Furthermore, I emphasize that I am not a professional and have acquired the necessary expertise on my own.
I do not accept any liability or warranty for your actions in any form.


A D50 fixed piping system is the best thing you can do for your pool. Please educate yourself on this topic. It makes sense to use D50 piping for pools of a certain size; it's essential for good pool operation. Check YouTube for more information; there are hundreds of videos on this topic.
 
The injection site has 3 openings for so-called injection valves. You can find the link to these in the BOM below. The 3 injection sites have ½ inch threads. I also got the injection valves from the same manufacturer. The hose connection is 4/6. The valve thread is 3/8. To fit the 3/8 inch valve into the ½ inch thread, a reducing thread is required. You can also get this through the website. Unfortunately, I no longer have the link, but you can simply contact the manufacturer or call them!

No separate control unit is needed for this WiFi-operated dosing system. The calculations and operation times for dosing are managed through the smart home. ioBroker is the tool of choice here. If you're not familiar with ioBroker, check YouTube to learn the basics. If you already have ioBroker up and running, congratulations. Just import the script and adjust it to your data points and preferences.
Attention: I am currently working intensively on the script. Please read the updates at the end for the current status.
